Electronics has been around for quite a while since the invention of the vacuum tube back in the 19th century. Despite the pervasiveness of electronics in the form of personal computers, cellphones, and pretty much anything one could find at their finger tips, you might've heard how Moore's law, and the electronic industry as a whole are facing a hard time moving forward. Therefore, other technologies (e.g. photonics, spintronics) would eventually take over, and reign supreme. This claim sensationalized by some media, however, is plain wrong. Electronics is here to stay, and nothing in the foreseeable future has the ability to replace it.

Why electronics? Well, because physics. In fact, let me be more precise here: because **fundamental physics**. 

Photonics, spintronics, DNA & bio- computing, etc. all have their own physics that tends to boast their respective advantages while brushing off the shortcomings. The fancy jargons of these fields tend to create an illusion that they exist in an entire different universe that allows fundamental physics to be bent. Unfortunately, this is not the case. 

Tracing all branches of physics back to the most fundamental, we see the **fundamental interations of nature** only have 4 flavors: gravitational, strong and weak nuclear, and electromagtnetic forces. Gravitational interaction, or gravity, is the weakest of the four, and only works on a macroscale. Most Goldberg machines utilize gravity to perform entertaining gigs. Gravity acts on all matters. The relative strength of gravity is 1. The two nuclear forces, weak and strong, are hard to tap into with current technologies to construct meaningful systems. Though nuclear forces have a relatve strength ~10^30, their effects have a range on the order < 10^-15m, meaning an atom is at least 10^5 times larger than how far nuclear forces extend. Try building a computer the size of an atom on a reasonable budget! Lastly, electromagnetic force has a relative strength ~10^36, and a range of action of infinity. The force carrier is photon, but charged particles are the ones actually affected. With the 4 fundamental forces reviewed, it is clear that all the aforementioned technologies use the electromagnetic interaction in one way or the other, with the exception of photonics if we were to be very pedantic about it. Spintronics, DNA & bio-computing use atoms and molecules with great masses. They cannot be very fast given the good old Newton's law of motion: F=ma. Electronics deals with electrons, *the* charged particles that hold one unit of elementary charge each. So you will NOT find a particle with the same amount of charge that is lighter than an electron. In fact, electrons themselves are light enough (1/10^4 of the lightest atom H) that according to quantum mechanics, they are also very small (wave-particle duality). This is why electronics beats photonics. Electrons have a wavelength usually <1nm, whereas "interesting" photons usually ~200-1000nm, ~1550nm, and >2000nm. How small are the electronic transistors you hear from Apple's latest ad campaign? 7nm? (7nm is actually *marketing terms*, but not too exaggerated) Now picture transistors as tiny switches, and electrons as tiny marbles powering them. The marbles better be smaller than the switches they are powering. Photons, with their larger sizes, can only fit in larger structures. Therefore, one cannot pack as many photonic switches as electronic switches on a single chip of a given size. This is due to hard physics, not the status of photonic technologies. While photonics do flourish for some applications (optical fiber links, positioning, etc.), electronics will not be replaced because of its level of integration (ability to be packed densely).

In this post, I hope I've debunked some of the common myths about the demise of electronics by examining the fundamental physics that makes electronics so powerful. The physical fact that electrons are **light, small, and strongly interacting** makes the technology that utilizes them almost impossible to replace. 

For the next post, I wish to touch upon the myth that "everything can be digital, will be digital", and hopefully point out the fact that *digital circuits are made from analog parts!* 

Stay tuned!
